# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the third project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

1. Circle animation seems slightly choppy. A smoother transition would be better.
2. Video size may be too small. Can find a way to make it take up more of the page.
